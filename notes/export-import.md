# Difference Between Export Statements

The difference between the two export statements `export { HelloWorld };` and `export default DoorPolicy;` lies in their usage and the way they are imported in other modules. Here's a breakdown of each:

## 1. Named Exports (`export { HelloWorld };`)

- **Definition:** Named exports allow you to export multiple variables, functions, or classes from a module. Each exported member must be imported using the exact same name as it was exported.

- **Syntax:**

```javascript
  // Exporting multiple named exports
  export const foo = 'foo';
  export const bar = 'bar';
  export class HelloWorld {
    static greet() {
      console.log("Hello, World!");
    }
  }
```

- **Importing: When you import named exports, you must use curly braces and the exact name of the export:**

```javascript
import { HelloWorld, foo } from './HelloWorld.js';
```

## Use Case for Named Exports

Use named exports when you want to export multiple items from a module, allowing users the flexibility to import only what they need.

## 2. Default Exports (`export default DoorPolicy;`)

- **Definition:** A default export allows you to export a single value from a module. This value can be a variable, function, class, or object. You can only have one default export per module.

- **Syntax:**

```javascript
class DoorPolicy {
  // ...
}
export default DoorPolicy;
```

- **Importing Default Exports** When you import a default export, you do not use curly braces, and you can name the import whatever you like:

```javascript
import DoorPolicy from './DoorPassword.js';
```

## Use Case for Default Exports

Use a default export when your module primarily exports a single value, making it more intuitive for users of your module.

## Summary of Differences

| Feature                   | Named Exports                   | Default Exports             |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Number of exports         | Can export multiple members      | Only one per module          |
| Import syntax             | Must use curly braces and exact name | No curly braces; any name can be used |
| Use case                 | Useful for modules with multiple functionalities | Ideal for a module that represents a single concept |

## Example in Context

- If `HelloWorld` represents a utility function or class that can be used alongside other exports, you’d use `export { HelloWorld };` as a named export.
- If `DoorPolicy` is the primary functionality of its module, you’d use `export default DoorPolicy;` to indicate that it’s the main export.

Choosing between the two depends on how you want users of your module to interact with it and how many different items you want to expose.
